## A. Introduction

The efficiency of railway system plays an important role for public transportation, especially in urban areas like Tokyo. It enables everyone to reach their destination in the most efficient way possible. In this project, we will simulate that system using AI to find the shortest path and the most efficient ones. This will involve creating an AI pathfinding system that can improve route selection and train management to maximize the efficiency for anyone from Tokyo.

Transportation systems in large cities often face challenges such as inefficiency and delays, especially as population grows. These problems can lead to enviromental concerns, wasted time and also economic losses. To address these issues we can make use of advanced technologies like Artificial Intellegence to improve transportation quality. By analizing dataset from a railroad systems like for example the shinkansen (Japanâ€™s high-speed rail network), AI can help optimize schedules and routes for trains to reach the destination

Optimizing Shinkansen rail track usage requires efficient search algorithms to enhance routing, scheduling, and energy management. The Best Search Algorithm helps identify optimal paths by considering factors such as travel time and cost-effectiveness, while BFS (Breadth-First Search) ensures all potential routes are explored, maximizing track utilization. A* algorithm, with its heuristic-based approach, further improves this by dynamically planning routes with an extended pre-sight, allowing it to anticipate future network conditions, such as congestion or track availability. This dynamic planning helps reduce delays and energy consumption by selecting routes that minimize accelerations, decelerations, and elevation changes, making the entire system more energy-efficient and cost-effective. The combination of these algorithms ensures that Shinkansen operations are optimized for both performance and sustainability, providing smoother operations while significantly reducing operational costs.
